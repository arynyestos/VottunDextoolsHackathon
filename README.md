# BitChill

BitChill is an automated Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) protocol designed to simplify the process of investing in Bitcoin (Rootstock's rBTC) using the Dollar on Chain stablecoin (DOC). The protocol enables users to automate their Bitcoin purchases at predefined intervals, providing a sensible and user-friendly approach to saving and investing in the volatile crypto market.

## Features

- **Automated DCA:** Deposit your DOC and BitChill will take care of the DCA process, automatically executing Bitcoin purchases for you.
- **Integration with Tropykus Protocol:** Earn a 7% APY by lending your full DOC amount in the Tropykus protocol.
- **Collateralized Borrowing:** Use accumulated rBTC as collateral for borrowing additional DOC.

## Hackathon outcome

üèÜ The BitChill team won the first Vottun prize, as you can see [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7158836419665313792/). üèÜ

After 24 hours of tireless (and almost non-stop) work, we made enough progress and pitched our project well enough to be awarded the first prize.

## Disclaimer 

The hackathon lasted a very short amount of time, which is why, although the smart contract, the front end and the back end were all readyish, we didn't get to combine them all toghether to make a fully functional MVP. Since I was the smart contract developer, you can see the progress I made in the smart-contracts [branch](https://github.com/arynyestos/VottunDextoolsHackathon/tree/smart-contracts). However, this repo won't be updated any longer, nor will the front and back end be uploaded here, since we intend to continue the project and have created a GitHub organization to carry on developing there.
