# DCA Smart Contract
This is the branch for the DCA smart contract developed during the hackathon.

The contract was deployed and verified on Rootstock Testnet, as you can see [here](https://rootstock-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0xe7dB4d12e5d4BfFE7a8936C3217937a6887c707C?tab=contract). 

## Functionalities
With the smart contract developed during the hackathon a user would be able to:
- Deposit and withdraw DOC 
- Configure purchase amount (at this stage of development, purchase frequency would be handled offchain)
- Make automatic purchases initiated through a CRON job running on a server. 
- Withdraw accumulated rBTC
